# 📊 Statistical Interactions in Significant Stock Price Changes Among Leading Electric Vehicle Manufacturers

## 📌 Project Description

This project examines the interaction of significant changes in the stock prices of leading electric vehicle manufacturers such as **Tesla, BYD, NIO, and Rivian**. Various **time series analysis** and **machine learning** techniques are used to explore dependencies and correlations between stock price movements.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Random Forest, SARIMA)
- **Time Series Analysis** (ADF Test, Granger Causality Test, VAR Model)
- **Financial Data Analysis** (Yahoo Finance API)

## 📂 Data Set

- **Source**: Yahoo Finance API
- **Time Interval**: Last **730 days**
- **Features**:
  - Opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices
  - Trading volume
  - Daily percentage changes

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Historical stock price data for Tesla, BYD, NIO, and Rivian is collected using Yahoo Finance API.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalizing data, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant financial indicators and preparing datasets for model training.
4. **Statistical Analysis:** Applying **ADF Test** to check stationarity and **Granger Causality Test** to determine causality relationships.
5. **Model Training:** Implementing **SARIMA** for forecasting and **Random Forest** for pattern recognition.
6. **Results Interpretation:** Visualizing insights and evaluating the interaction among stock price changes.
